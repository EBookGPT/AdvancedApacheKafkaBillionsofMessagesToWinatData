# Chapter 6: Kafka Connect - Uniting Robin Hood with Apache Kafka

Welcome back, dear readers! We hope the previous chapter on Kafka Producer Concepts has left you *keen on kafka* and left you hungry for more knowledge about this amazing data streaming platform. In this chapter, we are thrilled to be accompanied by a special guest, none other than *Robin Moffatt* himself! Our topic for today's discussion is Kafka Connect.

Kafka Connect is an open-source component of Apache Kafka that is used to integrate Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indices, and file systems. The best part? Kafka Connect is *crazy fast* and can handle billions of messages at ease.

Robin has been using Kafka Connect for years to transfer data between Kafka and other systems, making it possible for his Merry Men to access information and make swift decisions. For instance, Robin used Kafka Connect to stream data in real-time from a database of tax records to a Kafka topic, which his team of Merry Men used to determine the richest people to target for their unique brand of "redistribution of wealth."

Kafka Connect offers two APIs: Source and Sink. The Source API allows external data sources to push their data into Kafka, while the Sink API pulls data from Kafka and sends it to external sources. Both APIs are highly configurable and can be customized according to your precise requirements.

Let's hear from Robin himself on how he used Kafka Connect to solve a major challenge:

*"At one stage, my Merry Men and I had to deal with an urgent situation where massive amounts of tax data were being updated every minute. It was a tough job to keep this data updated in real-time, making it accessible to our team in a timely manner. Then we realized that we could leverage Kafka Connect to move this data from MySQL to Kafka. With Kafka's guaranteed message delivery and awesome scaling capability, the job became a breeze. We were able to handle billions of messages with insane ease and speed, and as always, the rich weren't spared!"*

Kafka Connect is a powerful tool that can eliminate data integration headaches and accelerate your data-driven initiatives. With its robust ecosystem of connectors, you can easily connect Kafka to almost any data source or sink, including Big Data systems such as Hadoop, Spark and Cassandra. Kafka Connect can be run as a standalone application, in distributed mode, or as part of a container orchestration system like Kubernetes.

In the next section, we will dive deeper into Kafka Connect concepts and show you how to get started with code samples. Robin will be our guide through this journey. So fasten your belts and get ready to embark on an adventure that will take you from robbing from the rich to winning at data-driven insights.
# The Story of Robin Hood and His Data-Driven Merry Men

Robin Hood and his Merry Men were always on the lookout for new ways to get ahead in their mission to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. With the exponential rise of data being generated every day, there was a need to employ new tools that could help them harness and analyze this data to make more informed decisions.

That's when Kafka Connect came to Robin's attention. He realized that with Kafka Connect, they could easily move data from sources such as databases, search indices, and even files into Kafka topics, where his team could make sense of it all in real-time. With millions of messages being transferred by Kafka Connect, Robin knew they could make more informed decisions.

But how would Robin and his team manage this vast amount of data, and make sure that their transactions and analyses were always up to date and accurate? The answer lay with Kafka Connect's Source and Sink APIs.

With Kafka Connect's Source API, Robin could pull data from external sources like a database, and push it into Kafka topics, ensuring that his data was always up-to-date with the latest information. And with Kafka Connect's Sink API, Robin could pull data from Kafka topics and send it to external sources, providing complete control over how his data flowed through the system.

As Robin's team got more comfortable with Kafka Connect, they began to explore its connectors, which opened up new possibilities for streaming data from external systems like Hadoop, Spark, and Cassandra. With these connectors, Robin and his team were able to access previously unavailable datasets, enabling them to extract insights that would have been impossible before.

With their new data-driven approach, Robin and his Merry Men were unstoppable. They had a wealth of information at their fingertips, and were able to respond to changes with lightning speed. No longer did they have to rely on intuition alone to decide who to rob from and who to help, they could back up their actions with hard data and statistics.

Thanks to Kafka Connect, Robin and his team were now more efficient and data-driven than ever before. And as they continued to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, they knew that they were doing it with the cutting-edge technology of Kafka Connect behind them.
# Code Solutions - Kafka Connect

To resolve the Robin Hood story, Kafka Connect was used to stream data in real-time from external sources to Kafka topics, where it could be accessed by Robin and his team of Merry Men. Let's take a closer look at the code used to implement Kafka Connect.

## Kafka Connect API

Kafka Connect offers two APIs: the Source API and the Sink API. The Source API allows external data sources to push their data into Kafka, while the Sink API pulls data from Kafka and sends it to external sources.

To implement the Source API, we first need to define the source connector class, which extends the KafkaConnector abstract class. This class implements the start and stop methods, which are responsible for handling the connector's initialization and finalization.

```java
public class MySourceConnector extends SourceConnector {
    // Constructor to configure the connector
    public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs) {
        // Configure the connector
    }

    // Method to start the connector
    public void start(Map<String, String> props) {
        // Initiate the connector
    }

    // Method to stop the connector
    public void stop() {
        // Gracefully terminate the connector
    }

    // Method to retrieve a list of tasks
    public List<Map<String, String>> taskConfigs(int maxTasks) {
        // Retrieve the task configurations
    }

    // Method to create a new task
    public Class<? extends Task> taskClass() {
        // Create and return a new task
    }

    // Method to get the version of the connector
    public String version() {
        // Return the version of the connector
    }
}
```

The Sink API has a similar structure, but with a different set of methods.

## Configuring Connectors

Before we can use our source or sink connectors, we need to define their configurations. This can be done through a configuration file, which we load when we start Kafka Connect.

```properties
name=MySourceConnector
connector.class=com.example.connector.MySourceConnector
tasks.max=1
topics=my-topic
```

Here, we define the name of our connector, the connector class and the properties that are needed to run the connector.

In our example, the connector class is `com.example.connector.MySourceConnector`, which corresponds to our source connector class. We also specify the `tasks.max` property, which defines how many instances of the connector should run in parallel.

## Running a Kafka Connect Cluster

To run Kafka Connect, we need to start a Kafka Connect cluster, which can be done through the command line. We can start Kafka Connect in either standalone mode or distributed mode.

In standalone mode, we run a single instance of Kafka Connect, which is suitable for testing and development purposes. To start Kafka Connect in standalone mode, we can use the following command:

```shell
$ kafka/bin/connect-standalone.sh connect-standalone.properties my-source.properties my-sink.properties
```

Here, we pass three configuration files: the first defines the Kafka Connect settings, while the latter two define our source and sink connector properties.

In distributed mode, we can run multiple instances of Kafka Connect, which provides high availability and scalability. Kafka Connect can run on any cluster manager that supports Apache Kafka, such as Apache Mesos, Apache Hadoop YARN, or Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

Kafka Connect is a powerful tool that makes it easy to move data between external sources and Kafka, empowering you to make more informed decisions based on real-time data. By understanding its APIs, configurations, and scalability options, you can unlock its full potential and build powerful data streaming pipelines like Robin Hood and his team of Merry Men.
